# Welcome to petwyse

## We are a team of enthusiastic people who wants to help this environment and the people and animlas residing on it.

For this purpose we have created a Medium through which Restraunts can List there left-over food and any person acting as a volunteer can pick that food and feed it to the needy street animals.

We would love to get any kind of help from you people so if you want to contribute to this project just follow the contributing guidlines and start contributing.

We also have some good-first-issues for the beginners.

Happy Hacking
